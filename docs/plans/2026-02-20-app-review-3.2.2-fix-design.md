# App Review 3.2.2 fix design

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Submission ID:** 83b2805c-650c-4bf6-91ff-0c6339f36324
**Guideline:** 3.2.2 — Business > Other Business Model Issues > Unacceptable
**Build reviewed:** v1.0 on iPad Air 11-inch (M3)

## Problem

Apple flagged the submission as "an interface for the display of third-party apps, extensions, or plug-ins in a manner similar to the App Store or as a general-interest collection."

The most likely trigger: the slash command panel groups shortcuts under category names that are the names of third-party tools (`"Claude Code"`, `"Aider"`, `"Codex"`), and at least one App Store screenshot (`ios-claude-code.png`) prominently features a third-party tool's branding. Together, these create an appearance of a "collection of supported apps," even though the runtime panel shows only text shortcuts with no branding.

## Strategy

Appeal the current build immediately. Fix the ambiguities in parallel so a clean build is ready if the appeal fails or a new build is needed.

## Part 1: Reply to Apple App Review

Send via App Store Connect message thread on submission 83b2805c-650c-4bf6-91ff-0c6339f36324.

> KeyJawn is an SSH terminal keyboard for developers. Its core function is to send key events (Esc, Tab, Ctrl, arrows) and text to SSH terminal sessions on servers the user configures.
>
> The "slash commands" panel is a text shortcut picker — tapping a command inserts a short text string into the active text field (for example, tapping "/compact" types the literal text "/compact" into the terminal). These are user-configurable text macros, not links to or representations of any third-party apps, extensions, or in-app purchases.

> The app does not sell, distribute, or link to third-party software. It does not embed or display third-party apps. It contains no storefront, no download mechanism, and no ratings or reviews. It is a keyboard with a text-autocomplete feature.
>
> We've also updated the app's screenshots and category labels to more clearly communicate this distinction. We're happy to provide a demo or answer any questions.

## Part 2: Code changes

### `ios/KeyJawnKit/Sources/KeyJawnKit/Models/SlashCommand.swift`

Rename `Category` enum cases from third-party tool names to functional descriptions of what the commands do. The panel does not display category labels at runtime, so this is invisible to users.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `claudeCode = "Claude Code"` | `session = "Session"` |
| `aider = "Aider"` | `context = "Context"` |
| `codex = "Codex"` | `files = "Files"` |
| `shell = "Shell"` | (unchanged) |
| `custom = "Custom"` | (unchanged) |

Update all call sites (the built-in `claudeCode` and `aider` command arrays) to use the new category names.

The commands themselves (triggers and descriptions) stay the same. Only the internal category enum changes.

## Part 3: Screenshot replacement

`website/public/screenshots/ios-screenshots/ios-claude-code.png` should be replaced with a screenshot that shows the keyboard in action — specifically the slash command panel open with shortcuts visible — without prominently featuring any third-party tool's brand name or logo as the focal point.

Suggested replacement: screenshot of the slash command panel overlaying the keyboard, showing `/compact`, `/clear`, `/add` etc. with the panel header "Slash commands" visible. Terminal content in the background can show a generic command prompt.

## Part 4: App description update

Audit the App Store description for phrases like "Claude Code slash commands" or "Aider slash commands." Replace with functional descriptions:

- "built-in text shortcuts for common CLI session commands"
- "customizable slash command shortcuts — type faster in any terminal"

## Implementation sequence

1. Send the Apple reply (no code changes needed)
2. Fix `SlashCommand.swift` category names
3. Replace the `ios-claude-code.png` screenshot
4. Update app description text in App Store Connect
5. Build and upload a new TestFlight build (v1.1 or increment build number)
6. If the appeal succeeds first: submit the clean build as the next update anyway
7. If appeal fails: cancel and resubmit with the new build
