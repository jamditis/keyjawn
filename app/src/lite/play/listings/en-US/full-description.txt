KeyJawn is a keyboard built for using LLM CLI agents from your phone. It gives you the terminal keys that standard Android keyboards don't have: Esc, Tab, Ctrl, arrow keys, and more — all in a dedicated row above a standard QWERTY layout.

Whether you're running Claude Code, Cursor, Warp, or any terminal-based AI agent, KeyJawn makes it possible to interact with them from your phone without fighting your keyboard.

Features:

- Terminal key row: Esc, Tab, Ctrl, up/down/left/right arrows, always visible above the keyboard
- Ctrl modifier: Tap for one-shot (Ctrl+C), long-press for sticky lock (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+K, etc.)
- Number row: Dedicated 0-9 row with long-press shifted symbols (!@#$%^&*())
- Voice input: Built-in speech recognition for hands-free text entry
- Slash commands: Quick-insert common CLI commands with the / key on the symbols layer
- Alt characters: Long-press letters for accented characters and common variants
- Clipboard history: Access your last 30 clipboard items with pinning support
- Multiple themes: Dark, Light, OLED black, and Terminal color schemes
- Per-app autocorrect: Toggle autocorrect on or off for each app individually
